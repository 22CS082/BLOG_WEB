# BlogWeb

This project is a simple blog website that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It is built using PHP for the backend, with HTML and CSS for the frontend.

Add Posts: Users can add new blog posts with a photo, title, and description.
View Posts: All blog posts are displayed in a list format.
Update Posts: Users can edit existing blog posts to update the photo, title, and description.
Delete Posts: Users can delete blog posts they no longer want to keep.
This project demonstrates basic CRUD functionality and is a great starting point for building more complex web applications.
